# Create: $ARGUMENTS

Create a specification (PRD), set up workspace, and define executable tasks — ready for `/ship`.

> **Workflow:** **`/create`** → `/ship`

## Pi Subagent Routing

When this prompt says to spawn, delegate to, or use an agent, invoke the pi-subagents `Agent` tool; an agent name is not itself a tool. This is not Fabric agent orchestration.

- `Explore`: internal codebase discovery
- `scout`: external documentation and research
- `review`: correctness, security, and regression review
- `general`: small independent implementation
- `Plan`: architecture and executable planning
- Use a foreground call when the next step depends on the result. For independent parallel work, issue all calls together with `run_in_background: true`.
- Omit `model` and `thinking`; agent definitions and scoped-model settings own those choices.
## Parse Arguments

| Argument        | Default       | Description                               |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `<description>` | required      | What to build/fix (quoted string)         |

## Determine Input Type

| Input Type  | Detection            | Action                        |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Quoted text | `"description here"` | Create PRD from description   |
| Short form  | Simple string        | Ask for more detail if needed |

## Before You Create

- **Be certain**: Only create specs you're confident have clear scope
- **Don't over-spec**: If the description is vague, ask clarifying questions first
- **Check duplicates**: Always check for existing work
- **No implementation**: This command creates specs and workspace — don't write implementation code
- **Verify PRD**: Before saving, verify all sections are filled (no placeholders)
- **Flag uncertainty**: Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers for unknowns — never guess silently

## Available Tools

| Tool      | Use When                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Explore` | Finding patterns in codebase, affected files |
| `scout`   | External research, best practices            |

## Phase 1: Duplicate Check

### Context Search

Search `.pi/artifacts/MEMORY.md` for: prior decisions, similar work.

```bash
rg -n "topic" .pi/artifacts/MEMORY.md
```

### Existing Work Check

Check `.pi/artifacts/.active` for existing work in progress. If active slug exists with a `spec.md`, ask user if they want to continue with `/ship` instead.

## Phase 3: Choose Research Depth

Ask user before spawning agents:

```typescript
question({
  questions: [
    {
      header: "Research Depth",
      question: "How much codebase research do you need?",
      options: [
        {
          label: "Deep (Recommended for complex work)",
          description: "3-5 agents: patterns, tests, deps, best practices (~2 min)",
        },
        {
          label: "Standard",
          description: "2 agents: patterns + tests (~1 min)",
        },
        {
          label: "Minimal",
          description: "1 agent: quick file scan (~30 sec)",
        },
        {
          label: "Skip",
          description: "I know the codebase, use existing knowledge",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Phase 4: Gather Context

Based on research depth choice, make one `Agent` call per bullet below. Calls within the selected depth are independent, so issue them together with `run_in_background: true`:

**If Deep:**

- 3x `Explore` (patterns, tests, deps)
- 1x `scout` (feature/epic)
- 1x `review` (epic)

**If Standard:**

- 2x `Explore` (patterns, tests)
- 1x `scout` (feature/epic only)

**If Minimal:**

- 1x `Explore` (patterns)

**If Skip:**

- No agents, use existing AGENTS.md context

**While agents run**, ask clarifying questions if the description lacks scope or expected outcome. For bugs, also ask for reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.

## Phase 5: Initialize Plan

Extract title and description from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If user provided a single line, use it for both title and description.
- If user provided multiple lines, use first line as title and full text as description.

Derive a kebab-case slug from the title. This slug becomes the feature's namespace:

```bash
SLUG=$(echo "$TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9 ]//g' | tr ' ' '-' | sed 's/--*/-/g; s/^-//; s/-$//')
mkdir -p ".pi/artifacts/$SLUG"
echo "$SLUG" > ".pi/artifacts/.active"
```

## Phase 6: Determine PRD Rigor

Not every change needs a full spec. Assess complexity to choose the right PRD level:

| Signal | Lite PRD | Full PRD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Simple, single-concern | Cross-cutting, multi-system |
| Files affected | 1-3 | 4+ |
| Research depth | Skip or Minimal | Standard or Deep |
| Description | "Fix X in Y" | "Implement X with Y and Z" |

**Auto-detect:** If research was Skip/Minimal AND description is a single sentence → default to Lite.

### Lite PRD Format

For simple, well-scoped work (bugs, small tasks):

```markdown
# [Title]

## Problem
[1-2 sentences: what's wrong or what's needed]

## Solution
[1-2 sentences: what to do]

## Affected Files
- `src/path/to/file.ts`

## Tasks
- [ ] [Task description] → Verify: `[command]`

## Success Criteria
- Verify: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint`
- Verify: `[specific test or check]`
```

### Full PRD Format

For features and complex work, use the full template:

Read the PRD template and write it to the active feature's spec (`.pi/artifacts/$(cat .pi/artifacts/.active)/spec.md`).

## Phase 7: Write PRD

Copy and fill the PRD template (lite or full) using context from Phase 4.

**If Lite PRD:** Fill the lite format directly. No template file needed.

**If Full PRD:** Read the template and fill all required sections:

| Section           | Source                                                     | Required          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Problem Statement | User description + clarifying questions                    | Always            |
| Scope (In/Out)    | User input + codebase exploration                          | Always            |
| Proposed Solution | Codebase patterns + user intent                            | Always            |
| Success Criteria  | User verification + test commands (must include `Verify:`) | Always            |
| Technical Context | Explore agent findings                                     | Always            |
| Affected Files    | Explore agent findings (real paths from Phase 4)           | Always            |
| Tasks             | Derived from scope + solution                              | Always            |
| Risks             | Codebase exploration                                       | Feature/epic only |
| Open Questions    | Unresolved items from Phase 4                              | If any exist      |

### Task Format

Tasks must follow this format:

- Title with `[category]` tag
- One-sentence **end state** description (not step-by-step)
- Metadata block: `depends_on`, `parallel`, `conflicts_with`, `files`
- At least one verification command per task

## Phase 8: Validate PRD

Before saving, verify:

- [ ] No placeholder text remains (e.g., "[Clear description", "[List what's allowed]")
- [ ] Success criteria include `Verify:` commands
- [ ] Technical context references actual `src/` paths from exploration
- [ ] Affected files list real paths
- [ ] Tasks have `[category]` headings
- [ ] Each task has verification
- [ ] No implementation code in the PRD
- [ ] No unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain (convert to Open Questions or resolve)

If any check fails, fix it — don't ask the user.

## Phase 9: Prepare Workspace

### Workspace Check

```bash
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
```

- If uncommitted changes: ask user to stash, commit, or continue

### Create Branch

### Workspace Setup

Set up the workspace: create branch, install deps if needed.

Additionally offer a "Create worktree" option:

```typescript
read(".pi/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md");
```

## Phase 10: Convert PRD to Tasks

Convert the PRD markdown into `.pi/artifacts/$(cat .pi/artifacts/.active)/tasks.json`, matching the task schema consumed by `/ship`.

## Phase 11: Report

Output:

1. Summary: task count, success criteria count, affected files count
2. Branch name and workspace (if claimed)
3. Active feature: `.pi/artifacts/$(cat .pi/artifacts/.active)/`
4. Next step: `/ship` (or `/plan` for complex work)
