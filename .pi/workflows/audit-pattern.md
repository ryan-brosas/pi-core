# audit-pattern

Find all occurrences of a code pattern in the codebase, review each match for correctness/security/edge-cases, and produce prioritized remediation recommendations. Use for cross-cutting concerns like auth checks, error handling, or API patterns.

## Pi Subagent Execution

Use the pi-subagents `Agent` tool, not Fabric agents, actors, or mesh:

```typescript
Agent({
  subagent_type: "<configured name>",
  description: "<short task label>",
  prompt: `<self-contained phase prompt with resolved inputs and output contract>`,
  run_in_background: true, // only for independent concurrent calls
});
```

- Concurrency 1: omit `run_in_background`, consume the foreground result, then continue.
- Concurrency >1 or dynamic: issue all independent calls together with `run_in_background: true`; let smart join return the group. Do not poll.
- Do not start a dependent phase until upstream results are available.
- Omit `model` and `thinking`; scoped agent definitions own those settings.
- The parent resolves placeholders before dispatch, synthesizes results, inspects child changes, and runs verification itself.

## Args

- `pattern` (required) — The code pattern to search for

## Phases

### Phase 1: discover

- **Subagent type:** `Explore`
- **Concurrency:** 1
- **Prompt:**

Search the codebase for the pattern: {pattern}. Use grep or csearch to find every occurrence. List each file with line numbers, grouped by subdirectory. If the pattern has common variations, include those too. Return results in this format:

## Directory: [path]
- `file.ts:42` — [brief context]
- `file.ts:87` — [brief context]

Keep each entry under 50 words.

### Phase 2: audit

- **Depends on:** Phase 1
- **Subagent type:** `review`
- **Concurrency:** Dynamic (one disjoint shard of about 10 occurrences per agent, min 1, max 15)
- **Dispatch:** The parent partitions Phase 1 into non-overlapping `{occurrence_shard}` values and issues one call per shard. Never send the complete occurrence list to every reviewer.
- **Prompt:**

Review only this occurrence shard for the pattern '{pattern}': {occurrence_shard}. For each occurrence check: correctness, edge cases, security implications, error handling, and adherence to project conventions. Return findings in this format:

## File: [path:line]
- **Severity:** [critical/important/minor]
- **Issue:** [description]
- **Recommendation:** [fix suggestion]

Keep each finding under 100 words.

## Final Synthesis (Main Agent)

After Phase 2 completes, synthesize the audit findings directly from {phase_2_output}.

Produce:
1. **Issues ranked by severity** — Critical, important, minor with file:line references
2. **Affected scope** — Count of files and occurrences
3. **Recommended fixes** — Specific fix suggestions per issue
4. **Correct patterns** — Patterns that are already correct and should be preserved

Group findings by subdirectory. Keep the report under 1500 words.
